This is a small application to generate invoices. It will give the option to generate all invoices into a single output file, or as a single pdf per invoice.
In another project I also import data from excel directly, but the effort for a quick manual input seemed lower than to explain to me the values in excel that had to be checked again anyway when creating the invoices.
